# Text Summarization System

## Purpose
Develop an advanced text summarization system using the BART model for efficient extraction of key information from large volumes of text.

## Software / Equipment

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Transformers by Hugging Face
- pandas

### Hardware
- GPU (if available)

## How to Run

1. **Generate Models**:
    ```sh
    python dl.py
    ```

2. **Check Model Accuracy**:
    ```sh
    python eval.py
    ```

3. **Run Text Summarizer Application**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

The text summarization system utilizes the BART model to generate accurate and coherent summaries for various types of input texts.
